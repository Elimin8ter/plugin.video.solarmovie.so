### If the progressBG part causes the plugin to not run at all, please let me know and I'll look into another method.
### I'm hoping this feature will allow people with Nightly Release and such (those above Frodo stable release) to use ProgressBG method.
### I'm going to leave this option open though in case anyone wants to use it or play around with fixing it.
### Canceling Downloads seems to be major issues atm.  This is both on Progress and ProgressBG.
### Progress and ProgressBG should both download where possible.
### Testing is for my use, and Hidden isn't completely tested, but should download.
### 4 Methods setup: DialogProgress | DialogProgressBG | Test (for my use in making another method) | Hidden.
- Links Listing >> Download Video -- Needs pleanty of testing and some more work yet.
### There is still the option to dissable the metadata on Episodes in the settings window, if want to.
### Things seem to be working, well enough for now, with Episodes and Episode MetaData.
- I Also a quick fix to catch the  episodes with only a Single "Link" that was getting missed by the call for "Links</a>"
- OK, I did a fix to where Seasons goto the individual Season page instead of the Main Show Page. This seems to fix things for shows like Doctor who or at least limits the prob to the season with the messed up stuff in it.
### If anyone has a suggestion to fix this little issue, please let me know on #xbmchub @ irc.freenode.net (user: HIGHWAY99).
### Weird enough, it seems to work fine on Hell's Kitchen which has 11+ seasons.
### Can be laggy yet on episode listings for shows that have a HUGE number of seasons/episodes, such as doctor who with 7+ seaons.
- Fixed the annoyingly huge lag issue I had for a while with Episode Listings.
- Settings >> Added option to dissable Metadata for default Episode Listings' Plot Description.
- Settings >> Added option to dissable Metadata for default Episode Listings.
- Item Listings >> Page Number Handling for End Page, Last Page, and Next Page given a major overhaul and super Fix!
- Settings >> Configured Number of Pages for Item Listings is now used.
- Settings >> Configured Enable Setting for View-Modes.
- Settings >> Configured Value Settings for View-Modes.
- Setup a Dummy-Proofing sysytem in Settings to keep people with buggy mice or who are click-happy or even lagged... from accidental clicking of "Clear Favorites".  Once you've filled them with nice shows, it's a drag to loose them on accident.  PS: Razor Naga mice migt be a nice idea, but man does it suck once they go bad... so easily.
- Addon / Plugin - Settings >> Added Several Settings for upcoming changes.  Not currently active yet.
- Quick Fix: setview to episodes for tv >> lateast watched .

[B]Version 0.1.8[/B]
- Fix: Latest Watched -- Now links to Get-Links instead of Get-Seasons.
- Library >> TV >> Play From Library -- Feature works. I still need to work on label fixes for the player.
- Library >> TV >> Add Library -- Feature works.
- Library >> Movies >> Play From Library -- Feature works.
### Feature Requested on IRC Chat, #XBMCHUB @ irc.freenode.net.
### Thanks to author of SimplyMovies for their good example of how Library stuff works.
- Library >> Movies >> Add Library -- Feature works.
- Disabled "unicodedata" import, and made a quick & dirty fix to remove_accents() to deal with stuff elsewhere that used it. This should finally take care of that nasty unicode bunch of issues that had been plagueing me for ages.
- Partial work on an Advanced Search Feature.  Yes, some options do work in it, atm.  This feature brings up a menu and lets you select which type of information you want to change and loops back to the list of search options again until you click cancel or do-search.
- Forgot to make meantion of a bit of graphics updates. FYI, those with the 'primal' skin (which I got installed but don't use myself), you'll get to use the genre graphics from it... else my 1ch PrimeWire theme graphics... else 1ch Glossy_Black theme graphics... else the graphic set as '_artSun'.
- Settings -- Added a feature to let the user set the a Category-Type name or whatever text they want for the differant groups of Favorites. ( example: 'Current Series', 'Other Series', and 'Toons and Anime' )
- Settings -- Added the option to hide Empty Favorites #(s) options from the Menu Lists.
- A lot of code cleanup, some code compression.
- Updated Settings Window -- Hid the Metadata option.  Added the additional Empty Favorites #(s).
- I've edited listItems() to only show "tv" / "movies" depending on which section they are in, to prevent items of the other section type from being displayed with possibly bad links or being routed to the wrong plugin function next.  This helped for "Latest Watched", but should also allow for more easily doing stuff like other people's Favorites or Watch List. I'll think on adding some functionality for that another time.
- Noticed that "Latest Watched" had TV Shows in it too, not just movies. So, I've now added it to the TV section as well.
- Favorites -- Multi Groupings. This means you can save favorites to multiple groups. This is currently setup for 2 movie groups and 3 tv show groups. ( Example: Favorites, Favorites 2, Favorites 3 )  This should be nice when you want to save many TV Show favorites of differant types, such as general, family, anime, or *adult*.
- ( Movie | TV) >> BrowseByCountry (catches flag icons from the net).
